            dSCRT is a variable exchange rate (VXR) derivative for staked Secret
            (SCRT). What this means is that there is a contract that handles
            staking and compounding staking rewards for you, giving you an
            amount of dSCRT that equals your stake. The ratio between dSCRT and
            SCRT changes, which will reflect your staking rewards.
            <p>
              Example: You stake 100 SCRT, which is equal to 95 dSCRT. After 1
              year, your 95 dSCRT will be worth 130 SCRT, which is a 30% APY.
            </p>
            <p>
              dSCRT includes automatic compounding & private voting for
              governance. A governance token will be distributed amongst dSCRT
              users as well

          <DialogContentText>
            dSCRT's purpose is to provide a liquid, fungible token for a user,
            representing his stake in the network. This token will accrue value,
            in a similar fashion to PoS staking which will unlock farming, and
            yield compounding opportunities. The goal is not to optimize APYs
            for users, but rather:

              <p>
                <li>Automatic compounding of rewards</li>
                <li>
                  Compounding of rewards without triggering a taxable event (if
                  relevant)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creating a fungible token which allows double-dipping in DeFi
                  applications while still accruing network-level staking
                  rewards
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minimizing validator risk by spreading delegations out to
                  multiple validators{' '}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creating a mechanism for private & secret governance voting
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creating an asset class that accrues network-level staking
                  rewards while still remaining liquid
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enabling "private staking", where buying dSCRT on secretswap
                  effectively creates anonymous staking
